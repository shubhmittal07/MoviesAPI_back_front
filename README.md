## Movie.java

This code defines a "Movie" class, which is like a blueprint for creating objects that represent movies in a computer program. Let's break down the different parts:

Annotations:

@Document(collection = "movies"): This annotation indicates that instances of the "Movie" class should be stored in a database collection called "movies".
@Data: This annotation automatically generates standard methods like getters and setters for the class's fields.
@AllArgsConstructor: This annotation generates a constructor that accepts values for all the fields as arguments.
@NoArgsConstructor: This annotation generates a constructor with no arguments, which can be useful for creating objects without providing initial values.
Fields:

private ObjectId id;: This field is used to store a unique identifier for each movie.
private String imdbId;: This field stores the IMDb ID of the movie, which is a unique identifier for movies on the IMDb website.
private String title;: This field holds the title of the movie.
private String releaseDate;: This field stores the release date of the movie.
private String trailerLink;: This field contains a link to the trailer of the movie.
private String poster;: This field stores a link to the movie's poster image.
private List<String> backdrops;: This field holds a list of links to backdrop images related to the movie.
private List<String> genres;: This field stores a list of genres that the movie belongs to, like "Action," "Comedy," etc.
private List<Review> reviews;: This field is intended to hold a list of "Review" objects, which are not defined in this code snippet.
Constructors:

There are two constructors. The first one (without arguments) is generated automatically by @NoArgsConstructor. The second one (with arguments) is a custom constructor that takes in various values and sets the corresponding fields of a "Movie" object.
Overall, this code defines a class called "Movie" that represents movie information. It includes fields for various attributes of a movie, such as its title, release date, and more. This class can be used to create instances representing different movies in a program, and these instances can then be stored in a database collection for further use.

## MovieController
This code is about creating a part of a web application that handles movie-related information. Let's break it down:

@RestController: This is like a special tag that tells the program that this class is in charge of handling incoming requests from a web client (like a browser or a mobile app). It's responsible for providing responses to these requests.

@RequestMapping("api/v1/movies"): This is another special tag that sets up a specific URL path, or endpoint, where the requests related to movies will be directed. In this case, the endpoint is "api/v1/movies", meaning that when someone sends a request to this URL, it will be handled by the methods in this class.

public class MovieController: This is the actual class that defines the behavior of handling movie-related requests.

public ResponseEntity<String> allmovies(): This is a method (or function) named allmovies that will be executed when someone sends a request to the specified endpoint. Here's what this method does:

It returns an instance of ResponseEntity<String>, which is like a package containing the response that will be sent back to the requester.
ResponseEntity is a way to customize the response with a specific HTTP status code (like OK, NOT FOUND, etc.), headers, and a response body.
<String> after ResponseEntity indicates that the response body will be of type String.
The response body in this case is simply the text "All Movies".
return new ResponseEntity<String>("All Movies", HttpStatus.OK);: This line creates a new instance of ResponseEntity containing the string "All Movies" as the response body. It also sets the HTTP status code to OK (which means everything is okay).

In a nutshell, this code sets up a controller for a web application that handles movie-related requests. When someone accesses the URL "api/v1/movies", the allmovies method is triggered, and it responds with a simple message "All Movies" along with an HTTP status code of OK. This is a basic example, and in a real application, the controller would likely interact with a database to fetch actual movie data and send it back as a response.
